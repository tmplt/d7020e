# klee-examples

This repo contains a set of usage examples for `klee-sys` low-level KLEE bindings. For more information on internal design behind see the [klee-sys](https://gitlab.henriktjader.com/pln/klee-sys) repo.

See section `Cargo.toml` for detaled information on features introduced.

### General dependencies

- llvm toolchain tested with (9.0.1)
- rustup tested with 1.40.0 (73528e339 2019-12-16)
- klee tested with KLEE 2.1-pre (https://klee.github.io)

- cargo-klee (installed from git)

---

## Basic test examples

- `paths.rs`

    This example showcase the different path termintaiton conditions possible and their effect to KLEE test case generation.

- `assume_assert.rs`

    This example showcase contract based verification, and the possibilies to extract proofs.

- `struct.rs`

    This example show the case of partially symbolic structures.

---

## Hardware oriented test examples

- `vcell_test.rs`

    Simple test to showcase low-level [vcell](https://github.com/perlindgren/vcell) access. `vcell` underlies all machine generated hardware accesses in the Rust embedded ecosystem.

    The `klee-analysis` feature replaces `read` operations to memory by symbolic values (using `klee-sys`). `write` operations are suppressed as for analysis we are not interested in the side effects.

- `register_test.rs`

    Simple test to showcase the use of the `volatile-register` abstraction. `volitile-register` builds on `vcell` and is used by both hand written and machine generated hardware accesses in the Rust embedded ecosystem.

    This example also showcase the `gdb` replay functionality.

    TODO: perhaps better to put the `gdb` replay in the Basic test examples, 
    as replay is not tied to `volatile-register`.

- `cortex-m-test1.rs`

   Simple test to showcase the [cortex-m](https://github.com/perlindgren/vcell) abstraction of ARM-core peripherals ARM thumb assembly instructions and ARM thumb CPU registers. `cortex-m` uses the `volatile-register` abstraction for ARM-core peripherals. The `klee-analysis` feature replaces read operations on CPU registers by symbolic data and suppresses write operations as for analysis we are not interested in the side effects.

   Moreover the example showcase the discrepancies between Rust source code paths and paths in the generated (semantically equivalent) LLVM-IR.  

   TODO: perhaps the latter part should be moved to Basic test examples as it is not `cortex-m` specific.

- `cortex-m-test-nightly.rs`

    This example showcase how compiler "intrinsics" can be safely adopted by proving the absence of errors.

    TODO: perhaps this part should also be moved to Basic test examples as it is not `cortex-m` specific.

## Testing on hardware

### Additional Dependencies:

- `stm32401` Nucleo64 board or similar with recent `stlink` firmware (tested with latest firmware as of 2020-01-10).
- `openocd` (tested with version 0.10.0)
- `arm-none-eabi-gdb` (tested with version 0.8.3)
- llvm target `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` 
  - `> rustup show`, to show current Rust tool-chain and installed targets.
  - `> rustup target add <target>`, to add target, e.g., `thumbv7em-none-eab¡hf`.
  
### Examples

- `f401_minimal.rs`

This example showcase the execution of code on the stm32f401 (and similar targets from the f4).
