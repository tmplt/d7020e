// This implies that hardware reads are made symbolic, while writes are surpressed.

// KLEE: done: total instructions = 663

//
// So, previously we made the claim that all `klee_abort` calls will render a unique test,
// but clearly this is not the case here.
//
// What happened is that the LLVM-IR the code has already been optimized to
// to semantically equivalent LLVM-IR representation.
//
// ; Function Attrs: nounwind nonlazybind
// define void @main() unnamed_addr #4 !dbg !1013 {
//     start:
// ...
//   call void @klee_make_symbolic(i8* %_3.i.i.i, i64 %24, i8* %27) #14, !dbg !1145
//   %28 = load i32, i32* %symbolic_value.i.i, align 4, !dbg !1146
//   store i32 %28, i32* %a, align 4, !dbg !1119
//   call void @abort(), !dbg !1147
//   unreachable, !dbg !1147
// ...
//
// So what we see here, is that the if statement is nowhere to be found
// and we call @obort(), and the code below is unreachable (as abort() -> !)
//
// This is semantically equivallent to:
// if a == unsafe { S } {
//     // panic!();
//     klee_abort!(); // (A)
// }
// klee_abort!(); // (B)
//
// So LLVM-IR paths and source code paths are not necessarily equivalent.
// rustc (the Rust compiler) and LLVM is free to make any choices of the representation
// as long as the semantics (meaning) is preserved.
//
// Does that imply that (A) is unreachable (dead code)?
//
// Well that depends on the view...
// rustc and/or LLVM has decided it is redundant and therefore not present in the LLVM-IR.
//
// What about code coverage?
//
// In this case there would be no "test" that visits this path, thus
// "classical" coverage test, would indicate that we have not covered all source code paths.
//
// So classical code coverage would go down, indicating lower quality test (bad for certfication).
// However we can proudly claim that the "classical" coverage as a measure of quality is
// indeed at fault. It is not the source code we should worry about!
//
// Our test provides "complete" coverage regarding the semantics of the source code
// (as we have not missed any potential error).
//
// This example is of course contrieved, but showcase that "classical" measures/
// quality goals restated and certification procedures updated accordingly!
